# PWC_task_3-Diversity-Inclusion_dashboard-
Focusing on the telecom client's goal of improving gender balance at the executive management level, this dashboard visualizes metrics related to diversity and inclusion, offering insights into current trends and areas for action.

Description:

As part of the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, I worked with a dataset about Diversity and Inclusion in the HR department. I used Power BI to create a dashboard report that helps measure how well the organization is doing in terms of diversity and inclusion. To do this, I came up with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Diversity Ratio, Turnover Percentage, and Performance Rating.
The Diversity Ratio shows how diverse the workforce is by comparing the number of different types of employees, like gender or ethnicity. Turnover Percentage helps us see how many employees are leaving the company, which can give us clues about how satisfied people are with their jobs. Performance Rating tells us how well employees are doing in their roles.
By using this dashboard, the organization can make smarter decisions based on data, understand where they're doing well and where they need to improve in terms of diversity and inclusion. This helps them keep getting better and better at making sure everyone feels valued and included in the workplace.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

KPIs are measurable values that organizations use to track and evaluate their progress towards achieving specific business objectives. They are used to measure performance over time and allow organizations to make data-driven decisions based on actual results.

Conclusion:

The HR Diversity and Inclusion Analysis project is super important for keeping track of how diverse and inclusive a company's workplace is. It gives HR managers really useful info to help them make smart decisions based on data. By looking at things like how many different types of people work at the company and how satisfied employees are with their jobs, HR managers can figure out what's going well and what needs to be improved.
