# PWC_task_3-Diversity-Inclusion_dashboard-
Focusing on the telecom client's goal of improving gender balance at the executive management level, this dashboard visualizes metrics related to diversity and inclusion, offering insights into current trends and areas for action.

As part of the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, I worked with a dataset about Diversity and Inclusion in the HR department. I used Power BI to create a dashboard report that helps measure how well the organization is doing in terms of diversity and inclusion. To do this, I came up with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Diversity Ratio, Turnover Percentage, and Performance Rating.
The Diversity Ratio shows how diverse the workforce is by comparing the number of different types of employees, like gender or ethnicity. Turnover Percentage helps us see how many employees are leaving the company, which can give us clues about how satisfied people are with their jobs. Performance Rating tells us how well employees are doing in their roles.
By using this dashboard, the organization can make smarter decisions based on data, understand where they're doing well and where they need to improve in terms of diversity and inclusion. This helps them keep getting better and better at making sure everyone feels valued and included in the workplace.
